# What goes in the chests
# Each line contains:
# type, level, modid.name, minimum amount, maximum amount, NBT tag (from nbt.cfg)
#
# type must be gear, heal (food / health), or loot (treasure)
# level must be an integer from 1 to 8 representing the value / difficulty of guarding mobs
#       Normally this should be 1 to 7, a value of 8 will appear only in rare teasure chests
# modid is the official ID of the mod; for vanilla items the modid is "item"
# name is the in-code, unlocalized name
# minimum and maximum determine the stacks sizes
#
# You can now create alternate version in the SpecialChests folder and attach those to 
# dungeon themes.
